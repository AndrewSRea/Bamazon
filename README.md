# Bamazon Store

The Bamazon Store creates a list of products by ID, Name, Department Name, Price, and Stock Quantity.

The Bamazon Store app then prompts the customer to input the ID Number of the item the customer would like to purchase.

And then the prompt asks the customer how many of the chosen product the customer would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the Bamazon Store app application will check to see if the store has enough 
of the product to meet the customer's request.

If there is an insufficient amount of the chosen product, the app will return a phrase saying there is an "Insufficient quantity!"
of that product and prevent the order from going through.

If there is a sufficient amount of the product in the store, the customer's order will be fulfilled.

Happy shopping!
